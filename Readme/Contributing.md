# Contributing

There's still a lot of work to do here! I would love to see you involved! Some design decisions for the core of ReSwift are still up in the air (see issues), there's lots of useful documentation that can be written and a ton of extensions and tools are waiting to be built on top of ReSwift.

I personally think the best way to get started contributing to this library is by using it in one of your projects!
